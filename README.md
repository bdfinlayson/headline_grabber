## Project Name: Headline Grabber

## Project Description

In the age of information technology, staying informed is crucial. However, time constraints often limit peopleâ€™s ability to keep up with current events. By providing succinct updates on relevant topics and events, this application ensures that users stay well-informed without sacrificing precious time.

In response to the fast-paced digital landscape, we propose the development of a Python-based news aggregator. This application leverages web scraping techniques to automate the retrieval of news articles from diverse sources. It will provide users with a convenient way to stay informed. Through a user-friendly command-line interface, readers can efficiently access relevant news content.
